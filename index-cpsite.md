## About Me

I am a professor geology and geophysics at [California Polytechnic State University](https://calpoly.edu),
San Luis Obispo, where I am tucked away in the [Physics Department](https://physics.calpoly.edu) for safe keeping. 

This website is only about my Cal Poly activities. I am rehabilitating a [personal blog/website](https://jblog.blot.im/), you can check to see if it's back online.

- You can find out more about geology and geophysics at the [Cal Poly Geology website](https://www.calpolygeology.info/).
