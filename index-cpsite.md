## About Me

I am a professor geology and geophysics at [California Polytechnic State University](https://calpoly.edu),
San Luis Obispo, where I am tucked away in the [Physics Department](https://physics.calpoly.edu) for safe keeping.

- You can find out more about geology and geophysics at the [Cal Poly Geology website](https://www.calpolygeology.info/).
